abstract = {Density is a fundamental driver of many ecological processes including habitat selection. Theory on density-dependent habitat selection predicts that animals should be distributed relative to profitability of habitat, resulting in reduced specialization in selection (i.e. generalization) as density increases and competition intensifies. Despite mounting empirical support for density-dependent habitat selection using isodars to describe coarse-grained (interhabitat) animal movements, we know little of how density affects fine-grained resource selection of animals within habitats [e.g. using resource selection functions (RSFs)]. Using isodars and RSFs, we tested whether density simultaneously modified habitat selection and within-habitat resource selection in a rapidly growing population of feral horses (Equus ferus caballus Linnaeus; Sable Island, Nova Scotia, Canada; 42{\%} increase in population size from 2008 to 2012). Among three heterogeneous habitat zones on Sable Island describing population clusters distributed along a west-east resource gradient (west-central-east), isodars revealed that horses used available habitat in a density-dependent manner. Intercepts and slopes of isodars demonstrated a pattern of habitat selection that first favoured the west, which generalized to include central and east habitats with increasing population size consistent with our understanding of habitat quality on Sable Island. Resource selection functions revealed that horses selected for vegetation associations similarly at two scales of extent (total island and within-habitat zone). When densities were locally low, horses were able to select for sites of the most productive forage (grasslands) relative to those of poorer quality. However, as local carrying capacity was approached, selection for the best of available forage types weakened while selection for lower-quality vegetation increased (and eventually exceeded that of grasslands). Isodars can effectively describe coarse-grained habitat selection in large mammals. Our study also shows that the main predictions of density-dependent habitat selection are highly relevant to our interpretation of RSFs in space and time. At low but not necessarily high population size, density will be a leading indicator of habitat quality. Fitness maximization from specialist vs. generalist strategies of habitat and resource selection may well be apparent at multiple spatial extents and grains of resolution.},

abstract = {Survival of caribou (Rangifer tarandus) calves until 4 months of age was monitored for 8 years in four herds in northern British Columbia, Canada. The chief cause of mortality was predation by wolves (Canis lupus) and grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) and this mortality was correlated within years between all herds. More calves died in years with late springs when extensive snow patches remained during calving in June than in early springs when larger snow-free areas existed. Before calving and after birth, caribou cows sought to space themselves out on snow-free areas in small aggregations at high elevations above treeline. By placing themselves at high elevations, the females increased the distance between themselves and wolves and bears travelling in the valley bottoms, as well as the main alternate prey, moose (Alces alces), which calved only in forest cover at lower elevations. In addition, the reduced snow in early spring meant that there was more space for dispersion. The variation in calf survival for three herds was negatively correlated with the heterogeneity of the calving area. Snow cover disappeared in smaller patches in more rugged mountains regardless of spring phenology, thereby providing a more constant search area for predators from year to year. More uniform mountains had either extensive areas of snow cover (late years) or brown substrates (early years), thus greatly varying the space that predators had to search between years. As stochastic variation in snow cover at calving time alters the searching ability of predators, the aggregation responses of prey, and the spatial overlap between predators and prey, it promotes short-term stability of the prey and lessens the probability of extinction},

abstract = {A small herd of 15-31 caribou (Rangifer tarandus) inhabited a shoreline strip of habitat along Lake Superior from 1972 to 1983. By remaining near the shoreline, they were spaced away from the major distributions of wolves (Canis lupus) and lynx (Lynx canadensis) that hunted mainly inland for moose (Alces alces) and snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus), re- spectively. Lake Superior also provided a means of escape from wolves, and offshore islands constituted safe parturition sites. The persistence of this herd is consistent with the hypothesis that viable caribou populations cannot survive on ranges frequented by high numbers of wolves (maintained mainly by moose prey) unless there are special habitat features providing escape for cows with young calves.},

Seventeen Peary caribou were captured in 1993 and fitted with telemetry neck collars. Seven collars housed both a Satellite Platform Transmitter Terminal package and radio telemetry package; the other 10 collars all housed only the radio telemetry package. Three of the collared caribou, along with at least 16 of their companion animals, made inter-island water crossings by swimming between Ile Vanier and Massey Island or between Massey Island and Ile Marc in August 1993. Of particular note is that two-month-old calves, as well as adult caribou, were involved in some of the frigid saltwater crossings. The water crossing between Ile Vanier and Massey Island required a minimum straight-line swim of 2.5 km and that between Massey Island and Ile Marc a minimum 1.6 km swim, depending on points of entry and exit from the water. That evidence composes the first documented account of Peary caribou swimming between any of the Queen Elizabeth Islands.},

Although dispersal of caribou to adjacent islands has been suspected, no historical documentation has occurred to date. Herein, we report consistent detections of caribou sign on the adjacent island of Kagalaska over 2 summer field seasons (2010–2011), and visual detection of caribou on that island during the summer of 2011. Ecological impacts of caribou on Kagalaska are not strongly apparent at the present time and we do not know how many animals permanently occupy the island. However, establishment of a reproductively viable resident population on Kagalaska is worrisome and could set the stage for a step-wise invasion of additional nearby islands.},

Movements between George's Island caribou and nearby Mealy Mountain caribou were examined through satellite telemetry (April 2005 to April 2006). Demographic information was collected through aerial classification surveys. The predator-free island is currently maintaining a density of 22.5-26.5 caribou/km2 . Female survival appears high and the recruitment rate in late fall-early spring was 19.0-29.2{\%} calves. Mainland caribou moved very little throughout the year, travelling no more than 53.7 km on average from their initial collaring locations. Also, satellite data indicated no mixing between animals on George's Island and the mainland. The elevated caribou density and high proportion of calves suggest that George's Island could at times be acting as a predator-free recruitment area and that George's Island may be a subpopulation from which animals disperse to the mainland.},

We observed caribou hestitating to cross ice that had no snow cover and also saw caribou breaking through ice.

We necropsied one bull that we found dead after it had broken through the ice and remained in the water for more than 20 hours. The bull had died apparently from stress and hypothermia and had heavily traumatized areas on its forelegs and sternum from struggling to break the ice. We could not evaluate the overall extent of injuries and mortalities to caribou from their encounters with thin ice, although we observed signs that at least hundreds had broken through the ice on different lakes.},

abstract = {Freshwater lakes and rivers of the Northern Hemisphere have been freezing increasingly later and thawing increasingly earlier during the last century. With reduced temporal periods during which ice conditions are favourable for locomotion, freshwater bodies could become impediments to the inter-patch movements, dispersion, or migration of terrestrial animals that use ice-covered lakes and rivers to move across their range. Studying the fine-scale responses of individuals to broad-scale changes in ice availability and phenology would help to understand how animals react to ongoing climate change, and contribute to the conservation and management of endangered species living in northern environments. Between 2007 and 2014, we equipped 96 migratory caribou Rangifer tarandus caribou from the Rivi{\`{e}}re-aux-Feuilles herd in northern Qu{\'{e}}bec (Canada) with GPS telemetry collars and studied their space use. We measured contemporary (digital MODIS maps updated every 8 days, 2000–2014) and historical (annual observations, 1947–1985) variations in freshwater-ice availability and evaluated the concurrent responses of caribou to these changes.Ice had a positive influence on caribou movement rates and directionality, and caribou selected ice and avoided water when moving across or in the vicinity of large water bodies. When ice was unavailable, caribou rarely swam across (6 {\%} of crossings) and frequently circumvented water bodies for several km. Although ice phenology did not change significantly during our study, climate projections indicated that ice availability could decrease considerably before the end of the century, generating a {\~{}}28 {\%} increase in distance travelled by caribou during the early spring and fall migrations.We demonstrated that ice availability influenced the movements of a migratory arctic ungulate. Warmer air temperatures in the Arctic will undoubtedly modify the phenology of ice forming on freshwater lakes and rivers. If migratory caribou are unable to adjust the timing of their migrations, they could be forced to circumvent unfrozen water bodies more frequently and over broader areas, which may increase the distance, time, and energy they use to reach wintering areas. The long-term conservation of wide-ranging species will ultimately depend on our ability to identify the fine-scale behavioural reactions of individuals to broad-scale changes in climate and land use.},

abstract = {Generalist predators typically have broad diets, but their diets may become constrained when one species of prey becomes disproportionately available. Yet there is poor understanding regarding whether generalist predators exhibit stereo- typic relationships with pulsed prey resources. We used telemetry data from 959 woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou (Gmelin, 1788); 146 adult females, 813 calves), 61 coyotes (Canis latrans Say, 1823), and 55 black bears (Ursus americanus Pallas, 1780) to investigate how two generalist predators interacted with caribou neonates on the island of Newfoundland. We examined the similarity of patterns of habitat use between caribou and their predators across time and related this similarity to interspecific spatiotemporal co-occurrence and mortality risk for caribou neonates. The similarity in habitat use between coyotes and caribou mirrored variation in juvenile hazard risk, but had weak association with actual co-occurrence with caribou. Bears and caribou exhibited less similarity in habitat use during the calving season than coyotes and caribou. The relationship between habitat use of bear and caribou did not correspond with either co-occurrence patterns or overall risk for caribou neonates. Our work illustrates how risk for a prey species can be shaped differently based upon differences between the behavioural strategies of generalist predator species.},

abstract = {The recently diminished caribou (Rangifer tarandus) population in insular Newfoundland, Canada, has been severely limited by predation on newborn calves. These neonates are patchily distributed on the landscape; therefore, to adequately understand predator–prey interactions, the temporal and geographic extent of the distribution of caribou calves must be identified so that current areas with calves can be differentiated from areas without calves. We used telemetry locations of 309 caribou calves and 100 adult females from 4 herds, 2008– 2010, to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of caribou calves during the time when they were most vulnerable to predation, to evaluate the predictability of the calf resource among years, and to assess the degree of aggregation during calving. Patterns of calf distribution were predictable in time and space from year to year, with an average distributional overlap of 68{\%} between years. The dispersion of female caribou during calving varied among herds from highly aggregated (8{\%} and 20{\%} of herd range) to more dispersed (50–70{\%} of herd range). Postcalving (up to 9 weeks) distributions also varied among herds; the 2 more-dispersed herds remained sedentary, whereas both highly aggregated herds migrated away from their calving grounds at the end of June. The most-aggregated herd remained so as it migrated from its calving ground, whereas the less-aggregated herd spread out and moved in a variety of predictable directions. Dispersion and movement patterns varied with forest cover; herds with less forest cover in their range were more aggregated and migratory than herds with more forest cover.},

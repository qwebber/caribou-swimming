abstract = {A small herd of 15-31 caribou (Rangifer tarandus) inhabited a shoreline strip of habitat along Lake Superior from 1972 to 1983. By remaining near the shoreline, they were spaced away from the major distributions of wolves (Canis lupus) and lynx (Lynx canadensis) that hunted mainly inland for moose (Alces alces) and snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus), re- spectively. Lake Superior also provided a means of escape from wolves, and offshore islands constituted safe parturition sites. The persistence of this herd is consistent with the hypothesis that viable caribou populations cannot survive on ranges frequented by high numbers of wolves (maintained mainly by moose prey) unless there are special habitat features providing escape for cows with young calves.},

abstract = {The movement patterns and demographic parameters were measured for caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) on George's Island (Labrador, Canada) to determine if the population is separate from the Mealy Mountain Caribou Herd. Movements between George's Island caribou and nearby Mealy Mountain caribou were examined through satellite telemetry (April 2005 to April 2006). Demographic information was collected through aerial classification surveys. The predator-free island is currently maintaining a density of 22.5-26.5 caribou/km2 . Female survival appears high and the recruitment rate in late fall-early spring was 19.0-29.2{\%} calves. Mainland caribou moved very little throughout the year, travelling no more than 53.7 km on average from their initial collaring locations. Also, satellite data indicated no mixing between animals on George's Island and the mainland. The elevated caribou density and high proportion of calves suggest that George's Island could at times be acting as a predator-free recruitment area and that George's Island may be a subpopulation from which animals disperse to the mainland.},

@article{Leblond2016,
abstract = {Freshwater lakes and rivers of the Northern Hemisphere have been freezing increasingly later and thawing increasingly earlier during the last century. With reduced temporal periods during which ice conditions are favourable for locomotion, freshwater bodies could become impediments to the inter-patch movements, dispersion, or migration of terrestrial animals that use ice-covered lakes and rivers to move across their range. Studying the fine-scale responses of individuals to broad-scale changes in ice availability and phenology would help to understand how animals react to ongoing climate change, and contribute to the conservation and management of endangered species living in northern environments. Between 2007 and 2014, we equipped 96 migratory caribou Rangifer tarandus caribou from the Rivi{\`{e}}re-aux-Feuilles herd in northern Qu{\'{e}}bec (Canada) with GPS telemetry collars and studied their space use. We measured contemporary (digital MODIS maps updated every 8 days, 2000–2014) and historical (annual observations, 1947–1985) variations in freshwater-ice availability and evaluated the concurrent responses of caribou to these changes.Ice had a positive influence on caribou movement rates and directionality, and caribou selected ice and avoided water when moving across or in the vicinity of large water bodies. When ice was unavailable, caribou rarely swam across (6 {\%} of crossings) and frequently circumvented water bodies for several km. Although ice phenology did not change significantly during our study, climate projections indicated that ice availability could decrease considerably before the end of the century, generating a {\~{}}28 {\%} increase in distance travelled by caribou during the early spring and fall migrations.We demonstrated that ice availability influenced the movements of a migratory arctic ungulate. Warmer air temperatures in the Arctic will undoubtedly modify the phenology of ice forming on freshwater lakes and rivers. If migratory caribou are unable to adjust the timing of their migrations, they could be forced to circumvent unfrozen water bodies more frequently and over broader areas, which may increase the distance, time, and energy they use to reach wintering areas. The long-term conservation of wide-ranging species will ultimately depend on our ability to identify the fine-scale behavioural reactions of individuals to broad-scale changes in climate and land use.},

abstract = {Satellite and conventional radio telemetry were used to obtain information on daily and seasonal movements of Peary caribou (Rangifer tarandus pearyi) on south-central Queen Elizabeth Islands, Northwest Territories, Canada. Seventeen Peary caribou were captured in 1993 and fitted with telemetry neck collars. Seven collars housed both a Satellite Platform Transmitter Terminal package and radio telemetry package; the other 10 collars all housed only the radio telemetry package. Three of the collared caribou, along with at least 16 of their companion animals, made inter-island water crossings by swimming between Ile Vanier and Massey Island or between Massey Island and Ile Marc in August 1993. Of particular note is that two-month-old calves, as well as adult caribou, were involved in some of the frigid saltwater crossings. The water crossing between Ile Vanier and Massey Island required a minimum straight-line swim of 2.5 km and that between Massey Island and Ile Marc a minimum 1.6 km swim, depending on points of entry and exit from the water. That evidence composes the first documented account of Peary caribou swimming between any of the Queen Elizabeth Islands.},

The observations were made on a portion of taiga winter range of the Beverly caribou herd during autumn migration in the Northwest Territories. We observed caribou hestitating to cross ice that had no snow cover and also saw caribou breaking through ice. Bulls had greater difficulty extricating themselves from the icy water than did relatively light-bodied cows and young individuals. We necropsied one bull that we found dead after it had broken through the ice and remained in the water for more than 20 hours. The bull had died apparently from stress and hypothermia and had heavily traumatized areas on its forelegs and sternum from struggling to break the ice. We could not evaluate the overall extent of injuries and mortalities to caribou from their encounters with thin ice, although we observed signs that at least hundreds had broken through the ice on different lakes.},

abstract = {The recently diminished caribou (Rangifer tarandus) population in insular Newfoundland, Canada, has been severely limited by predation on newborn calves. These neonates are patchily distributed on the landscape; therefore, to adequately understand predator–prey interactions, the temporal and geographic extent of the distribution of caribou calves must be identified so that current areas with calves can be differentiated from areas without calves. We used telemetry locations of 309 caribou calves and 100 adult females from 4 herds, 2008– 2010, to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of caribou calves during the time when they were most vulnerable to predation, to evaluate the predictability of the calf resource among years, and to assess the degree of aggregation during calving. Patterns of calf distribution were predictable in time and space from year to year, with an average distributional overlap of 68{\%} between years. The dispersion of female caribou during calving varied among herds from highly aggregated (8{\%} and 20{\%} of herd range) to more dispersed (50–70{\%} of herd range). Postcalving (up to 9 weeks) distributions also varied among herds; the 2 more-dispersed herds remained sedentary, whereas both highly aggregated herds migrated away from their calving grounds at the end of June. The most-aggregated herd remained so as it migrated from its calving ground, whereas the less-aggregated herd spread out and moved in a variety of predictable directions. Dispersion and movement patterns varied with forest cover; herds with less forest cover in their range were more aggregated and migratory than herds with more forest cover.},

In 1958–1959, caribou were intentionally introduced to Adak Island in the central archipelago, and the population has at least tripled in recent years subsequent to the closure of a naval air facility. Although dispersal of caribou to adjacent islands has been suspected, no historical documentation has occurred to date. Herein, we report consistent detections of caribou sign on the adjacent island of Kagalaska over 2 summer field seasons (2010–2011), and visual detection of caribou on that island during the summer of 2011. Ecological impacts of caribou on Kagalaska are not strongly apparent at the present time and we do not know how many animals permanently occupy the island. However, establishment of a reproductively viable resident population on Kagalaska is worrisome and could set the stage for a step-wise invasion of additional nearby islands.},

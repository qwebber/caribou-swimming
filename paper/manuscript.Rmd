The Fogo Island archipelago, off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada, is home to
approximately 300 woodland caribou. During routine fieldwork on May 30, 2017, we
observed an unmarked adult male caribou swim between Western and Eastern Indian
Islands (Figure 1, see Figure 2 for location), a distance of at least 470 m which took ~9 minutes (~52 m
per minute). This observation prompted us to investigate whether swimming
behaviour was common among GPS radio-collared caribou in the population (n = 29
adult females; 1240g, GPS 4400M; Lotek Wireless Inc., Newmarket, Ontario,
Canada). Using `r substr(version$version.string, 1, 15)` [@R], we identified
swimming events as two consecutive GPS locations (2-hour relocation rates)  from
an individual occurred on different islands. Northeastern Newfoundland typically
experiences pack ice during winter and caribou are known locally to travel
between islands by walking over the ice. We restricted our GPS data to the
ice-free period of the year (April 1 to December 31) and we identified `r nids`
adult female caribou that collectively had `r nevents` swimming events over
three years (Figure 2). In addition to our own visual and remotely sensed
observations, residents of Fogo Island have also reported observing caribou
swimming between islands on numerous occasions.

Caribou (*Rangifer tarandus*) are exceptional swimmers. Ample evidence exists
that caribou swim in streams, rivers, and lakes during migration [@Leblond2016],
to avoid predators [@Bergerud1985], and access islands during calving
[@Bergerud1990]. Even for adept swimmers like caribou, the energetic expenditure
of swimming for quadrupedal mammals is significantly higher than walking or
running, and drowning is also possible [@Miller1985]. Despite
the abundance of coastal and island caribou herds, only a handful of examples
have documented caribou swimming in the ocean [e.g. @Miller1995; @Miller2002;
@Jeffery2007; @Ricca2012].



In total, `r nevents` swimming events occurred throughout the ice-free season,
with peaks in May and November. On average, caribou swam approximately `r neventidMean`
(range = `r neventidMin`-`r neventidMax`) times per year and remained on each
island for approximately `r dur` (range = `r durMin`-`r durMax`) days before
swimming again. Caribou may swim between islands in the ocean for similar
reasons they swim in freshwater [@Leblond2016]. We propose that one such
explanation, the forage limitation hypothesis, is a likely explanation for
oceanic swimming for caribou that live on islands in the Fogo Island
archipelago.

Forage limitation and over-grazing is a major concern for caribou populations:
it can reduce female reproductive success [@Schaefer2016] and thus could lead to
movement between islands. Forage scarcity has been proposed as a potential
reason for caribou moving between arctic islands on the sea-ice in winter
[@Miller1977]. Caribou were introduced to Fogo Island (n = 26 animals between
1964â€“67) and Change Island (n = 5 animals in 1964) from Newfoundland as part of
a series of translocations and introductions throughout the province (Bergerud &
Mercer 1989). It is unknown when caribou began colonizing nearby islands, but
given that some are small, over-grazing by newly arrived caribou may rapidly
deplete forage on an annual cycle [@Bergerud1990]. Although unconfirmed, it is
also possible that Fogo Island has experienced forage depletion since the
introduction of caribou in the 1960s. More likely, however, is that fine-scale
competition for foraging resources drives caribou to swim to new islands.

Movement between islands requires caribou to assess the trade-off associated
with swimming. This trade-off can be understood as density-dependent habitat
selection governed by the Ideal Free Distribution [@Morris1987; @Bradbury2015].
Ideal Free Distribution theory predicts a fitness equilibrium: when the density
in a given habitat patch has exceeded the optimum for fitness within that patch,
animals should relocate and settle new habitat patches, so that fitness is equal
across all patches [@Bradbury2015]. Islands act as discrete habitat patches in
this case, but the costs associated with swimming create a trade-off when moving
between patches. For caribou in the Fogo Island archipelago, the role of forage
limitation in habitat selection patterns remains unknown, but swimming
between islands may be at least partially governed by density-dependent habitat selection.

In total, 12 of 29 collared female caribou swam between islands in the Fogo
Island archipelago. Only `r n10` of these 12 individuals had more than 10
swimming events, suggesting that for ~10% of collared individuals swim
relatively frequently, on average occurring approximately every `r indMean` days
during ice-free seasons. We did not detect any swimming events for the remaining
17 individuals. It remains unclear whether these individuals do not swim, or
whether swimming is rare, and thus undetected, for the majority of individuals.
Overall, there appears to be three groups of individuals: those that swam often
(n = 3, every ~`r indMean` days), those that swam occasionally (n = 9, every ~
`r ind2Mean` days), and those that never swam (n = 17). It is therefore possible
that individuals vary in their tendency to swim. We are also unable to draw
conclusions about the prevalence of swimming in the ocean by male caribou: our
initial visual observation was of an adult male, but our GPS data only included
adult females.

Oceanic swimming is relatively common among a minority of marked caribou. Of the
three collared individuals that swam the most, two were collared on Western
Indian Island and the third was collared on Fogo Island. Inter-island distances
between Western and Eastern Indian Islands, and the smaller islands around them,
are shorter than those between Fogo Island and others (Figure 2). It is possible
that caribou display natal philopatry [e.g. @Larue2018] to some of the smaller
islands and thus are more likely to swim between them more frequently than
animals that were born, or spend most of their time, on Fogo Island. The forage
limitation hypothesis is generally thought to apply uniformly across
populations, but individual caribou could evaluate the costs and benefits of
swimming to another island differently. It is possible that some individuals, in
our case ~10%, considered swimming to be less costly or perceived competition or
predation more acutely than their conspecifics.

For several decades after their introduction to Fogo Island, the caribou
population did not exceed ~100 individuals [@Bergerud1989, Newfoundland and
Labrador Wildlife Division, unpublished data]. During the 1990s, population
density reached ~300 animals and it is unknown when caribou began to occupy other
islands, although anecdotal evidence suggests it was during the 1990s. We surmise that as
competition among conspecifics increased along with population size,
density-dependent habitat selection resulted in expansion of the population to
nearby islands. Following Ideal Free Distribution theory, caribou should swim to
new islands when the average fitness of individuals on the starting island
exceeds the density-fitness equilibrium [@Morris1987]. While this is an ultimate
explanation, our data suggest caribou only remain on smaller islands for a few
days at a time, so the fitness equilibrium remains a theoretical construct. More
likely, however, is that fine-scale competition, density-dependent habitat
selection, and forage depletion drives individuals to periodically swim
between islands. Given the presumed low density of coyotes on Fogo Island and
the minimal risk they pose, predation risk does not appear to be a major driver
of swimming.

Our observations add to the evidence that caribou can, and occasionally do, swim
in the ocean [e.g. @Miller1995; @Miller2002; @Jeffery2007; @Ricca2012]. 
We suggest that swimming is likely more common than previously thought
for caribou living on oceanic islands, and that forage limitation and the
associated density-dependent habitat selection is an ultimate explanation for
this phenomenon. Although our inference is limited to observations, islands
appear to represent discrete foraging patches for terrestrial animals that can
influence fitness via increased foraging opportunities. We also posit that
individuals can vary in their evaluation of costs and benefits of movement
between these habitat patches.

<!-- edit caption Fogo Island is the largest
island in the archipelago (237.71 km^2^), but there are at least three other
large islands: Western Indian (77.6 km^2^), Eastern Indian (38.7 km^2^) and
Change (XX km^2^) Islands, as well as numerous smaller islands, including
Blundonâ€™s (1.18 km^2^), North Long (1.01 km^2^), South Long (0.48 km^2^), Kateâ€™s
(1.64 km^2^), and Brotherâ€™s (1.59 km^2^) Islands. Habitats are similar across
the archipelago, consisting largely of coniferous and mixed forests of balsam
fir (*Abies balsamea*), black spruce (*Picea mariana*), and white birch 
(*Betula papyrifera*) as well as bogs, lakes, lichen and rocky
barrens.-->

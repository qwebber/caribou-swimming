\newpage

Caribou (*Rangifer tarandus*) are exceptional swimmers. Ample evidence exists
that caribou swim in streams, rivers, and lakes during migration (Leblond et al.
2016) to avoid predators [@Bergerud_1985] and access islands during calving
(Bergerud et al. 1990). Swimming for quadrupedal terrestrial mammals can be
thought of as a set of trade-offs. Costs include high energy expenditure and
risk of drowning. Specifically, even though caribou are adept swimmers, the
energetic expenditure associated with swimming for quadrupedal mammals is
significantly higher than walking or running (Fish 1993), whiledrowning
is also possible (Miller & Gunn 1985). Despite a large number of coastal and
island caribou herds, only a handful of examples have documented caribou
swimming in the ocean (Table 1).

Here, we describe the visual observation of an adult male caribou swimming
between islands in the Fogo Island archipleago off the coast of Newfoundland,
Canada. During routine fieldwork on May 30, 2017, we observed an unmarked adult
male caribou swim between Perry and Eastern Indian Islands (Figure 1), a swim of
at least 470 m which took ~9 minutes (~52 m per minute). This observation
prompted us to query a large database of GPS radio-collared caribou. We
identified  86 remotely sensed swimming events between XX islands from three
individual caribou over a three-year period.

<!--DO WE NEED THIS SECTION?--> 
Caribou were introduced to Fogo Island (n = 26 animals introduced between
1964–67) and Change Island (n = 5 animals introduced in 1964) from the main
Island of Newfoundland as part of a series of translocations and introductions
throughout the province (Bergerud & Mercer 1989). While caribou populations are
in decline throughout Canada (Festa-Bianchet et al. 2011), as well as in
Newfoundland (Bastille-Rousseau et al. 2013), the Fogo Island herd has not
declined to the same extent and currently consists of approximately 300 animals
(Newfoundland and Labrador Wildlife Division, unpublished data). Since 2016 we
have been studying the Fogo Island caribou herd (Bonar et al. 2017; Bonar et al.
2018; Peignier et al. 2019). To date, we have fitted XX adult female caribou
with GPS collars (1240g, GPS 4400M; Lotek Wireless Inc., Newmarket, Ontario,
Canada), which were programmed to collect relocation fixes every 2 hours (see
Bonar et al. 2018 for details).

We posit two potential mechanisms explaining the trade-offs associated with
swimming in the North Atlantic Ocean: forage limitation and predator avoidance.
For caribou living on small islands in the ocean, the same notions for why
caribou swim in freshwater may also explain why caribou swim in the ocean
(Leblond et al. 2016). Specifically, forage limitation (Miller 2002) and
predator avoidance (Jeffery et al. 2007) have been proposed as potential
explanations.

The Fogo Island archipelago is located in Newfoundland, Canada (49°N, 54°W), and
comprises approximately ten islands. While Fogo Island is the largest island
(237.71 km^2^), the archipelago includes at least three larger islands: Western
Indian (77.6 km2), Eastern Indian (38.7 km2) and Change (XX km2) Islands, as
well as numerous smaller islands, including Blundon’s (1.18 km2), North Long
(1.01 km2), South Long (0.48 km2), Kate’s (1.64 km2), and Brother’s (1.59 km2)
Islands (see Figure 1). All islands in the Fogo Island archipelago consist
largely of coniferous and mixed forests of balsam fir (Abies balsamea), black
spruce (Picea mariana), and white birch (Betula payrifera) as well as bogs,
lakes, lichen and rocky barrens.

Forage limitation and over-grazing is a major issue for caribou populations
(Schaefer et al. 2016; Zamin et al. 2017) and could explain movement between
islands. Reduced access to foraging opportunities can result in higher
conspecific competition for resources and lowered reproductive success for adult
females (Schaefer et al. 2016). Forage scarcity has been proposed as a potential
reason why caribou move between arctic islands on the sea-ice in winter (Miller
et al. 1977).  For very small islands, over-grazing by newly arrived caribou may
rapidly limit forage (Bergerud et al. 1990). Without sea ice, movement from the
mainland to an island as well as between islands requires caribou to assess the
trade-off associated with swimming. 

The underlying mechanism driving forage limitation and the trade-off associated
with swimming could be density-dependent habitat selection governed by the Ideal
Free Distribution (Morris 1987; Bradbury et al. 2015). Ideal Free Distribution
theory suggests that habitat selection is density-dependent and that variation
in density between habitat patches leads to a fitness equilibrium (Bradbury et
al. 2015). Fitness in a habitat patch depends on density where, ideally, the
available resources on a habitat patch can sustain a specific number of
individuals. In a hypothetical example, when density of a given habitat patch
has exceeded the fitness equilibrium, animals are predicted to relocate and
settle new habitat patches to reach equilibrium. Islands therefore represent
distinct habitat patches with clear costs and benefits associated with swimming.
For caribou in the Fogo Island archipelago, the role of forage limitation in
animal habitat selection patterns and movement remains unknown, but it is
possible that forage limitation and increased conspecific competition influences
swimming between islands.

Predator avoidance could contribute to swimming behaviour of caribou (Miller
2002). Although caribou co-evolved with wolves (*Canis lupus*) throughout their range, wolves are extirpated from Newfoundland, including Fogo Island. Coyotes (*Canis latrans*)
and black bears are the primary predators of
caribou (Bastille-Rousseau et al. 2016). While predation by coyotes on adult
female caribou is possible, it is relatively rare on Fogo Island (Webber &
Vander Wal unpublished data). Therefore, any effect of predation on swimming
behaviour is likely related to fine-scale encounters between coyotes and caribou
which result in caribou swimming as a flight response. Alternatively, during
calving, females may swim to small islands to give birth (Bergerud & Page 1987)
or swim to islands with a calf at heel to avoid predation. Swimming with a calf
at heel has been observed for caribou in freshwater lakes on Fogo Island (Webber
& Vander Wal unpublished data), so we anticipate it may also be possible in the
ocean. We suggest future studies assess encounter rates among caribou and
coyotes to determine what proportion of encounters result in swimming
behaviour.Woodland caribou are well known to disperse to remote locations,
including islands, during calving (Bergerud & Page 1987; Cumming & Beange 1987).
Moving to remote locations is a viable anti-predator strategy for caribou
because it reduces detection and encounter rates by predators. For instance, the
use of shoreline habitat in summer was deemed an effective anti-predator calving
strategy because caribou avoided predators by using islands and peninsulas or
swimming as a flight response (Bergerud et al. 1990). The use of water, and by
association occasionally swimming, is therefore part of the fine-scale
interactions between caribou and their predators and the use of islands appears
to be an effective anti-predator strategy. Coyotes and black bears are
responsible for the majority of mortalities for neonate caribou calves
(Bastille-Rousseau et al. 2016), although predation can still occur after the
calving period (Lewis & Mahoney 2014). However, on Fogo Island, coyotes are the
only predator of caribou.




Caribou were introduced to Fogo Island in the 1960s and for several decades the
population did not exceed ~100 individuals (Bergerud & Mercer 1989; Newfoundland
and Labrador Wildlife Division, unpublished data). During the 1990s, population
density reached 300 animals and anecdotal evidence suggests that caribou began
to occupy other islands in the archipelago. We surmise that, as density
increased over time, competition among conspecifics and density-dependent
habitat selection resulted in expansion of the population to nearby islands.
Following density-dependent habitat selection theory, caribou should swim to new
islands when the average fitness of individuals on the starting island exceeds
the density-fitness equilibrium (Morris 1987). Animals would therefore be
predicted to swim to new islands (i.e. settle new habitat patches) to reach a
fitness equilibrium. While this is an ultimate explanation to a series of
proximate observations, it is possible for density-dependent habitat selection
to operate at such a fine-scale (Webber & Vander Wal 2018). Evidence from the
Sable Island horse (Equus ferus caballus) system corroborates our suggestion
that swimming among islands could be driven by density-dependent habitat
selection (van Beest et al. 2014). For horses, selection for high quality
habitat was highest when population density was low, but individuals tended to
settle in lower quality habitats as population density increased, following
Ideal Free Distribution theory (van Beest et al. 2014). Taken together, caribou
may follow density-dependent habitat selection (Wittmer et al. 2007) and as
population density increased, forage was depleted and competition increased.


Our observations represent the most frequent and numerous swimming events for
caribou in the ocean (for comparison see Table 1). While past observations (e.g.
Miller 1995, 2002; Jeffery et al. 2007; Ricca et al. 2012) have noted the unique
nature of caribou swimming in the ocean, we suggest that this behaviour is
likely more common than previously thought for caribou living on oceanic
islands. We posit forage limitation and density-dependent habitat selection is
an ultimate explanation for why caribou swimming in the ocean while predator
avoidance is a proximate explanation. Although our inference is limited to
observations, we suggest that because swimming behaviour is so common in our
system, that density-dependent habitat selection and predation are plausible
mechanisms explaining swimming behaviour in Fogo Island caribou.

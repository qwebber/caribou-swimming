**Introduction**

Caribou (*Rangifer tarandus*) are exceptional swimmers. Ample evidence exists
that caribou swim in streams, rivers, and lakes during migration [@Leblond2016],
to avoid predators [@Bergerud1985], and access islands during calving
[@Bergerud1990]. Even for adept swimmers like caribou, the energetic expenditure
of swimming for quadrupedal mammals is significantly higher than walking or
running, <!--[@Fish1993]--> and drowning is also possible [@Miller1985]. Despite
a large number of coastal and island caribou herds, only a handful of examples
have documented caribou swimming in the ocean [e.g. @Miller1995; @Miller2002;
@Jeffery2007; @Ricca2012].

The Fogo Island archipelago, off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada, is home to
approximately 300 woodland caribou. During routine fieldwork on May 30, 2017, we
observed an unmarked adult male caribou swim between Western and Eastern Indian
Islands (Figure 1), a distance of at least 470 m which took ~9 minutes (~52 m
per minute). This observation prompted us to investigate whether swimming
behaviour was common among GPS radio-collared caribou in the population (n = 29
adult females; 1240g, GPS 4400M; Lotek Wireless Inc., Newmarket, Ontario,
Canada). We identified swimming events as two consecutive GPS (2-hour relocation
rates) locations from an individual occurred on different islands. Northeastern
Newfoundland typically experiences pack ice during winter and caribou are known
locally to travel between islands by walking over the ice. We restricted our GPS
data to the ice-free period of the year (April 1 - December 31) and we
identified `r nids` adult female caribou that collectively had `r nevents` swimming events
over three years (Figure 2). In addition to our own visual and remotely sensed
observations, residents of Fogo Island have also reported observing caribou
swimming between islands on numerous occasions.

<!-- add numbers in here -->
In total, `r nevents` swimming events occurred throughout the ice-free season,
with a peak in November. On average, caribou swam approximately `r neventidMean`
(range = `r neventidMin`-`r neventidMax`) per year and remained on those islands
for approximately `r dur` (range = `r durMin`-`r durMax`) days before swimming
again. Caribou may swim between islands in the ocean for similar reasons they
swim in freshwater [@Leblond2016]. We propose that one such explanation, the
forage limitation hypothesis, is a likely explanation for oceanic swimming for
caribou that live on islands in the Fogo Island archipelago.
<!--Is it better
to just state our results here, or give this sort of teaser? Initially I had "86
events by 3 individuals" here, but then we ignore that for a couple paragraphs
of context before getting back into it... which seemed weird
QW: I agree. I've added some Fogo context-->

Forage limitation and over-grazing is a major concern for caribou populations
[@Schaefer2016] and could explain movement between islands. Conspecific
competition for resources driven by reduced foraging opportunities can decrease
reproductive success of adult females [@Schaefer2016]. Forage scarcity has been
proposed as a potential reason for caribou moving between arctic islands on the
sea-ice in winter [@Miller1977]. Caribou were introduced to Fogo Island (n = 26
animals between 1964â€“67) and Change Island (n = 5 animals in 1964) from
Newfoundland as part of a series of translocations and introductions throughout
the province (Bergerud & Mercer 1989). It is unknown when caribou began
colonizing nearby islands, but given that some are small, over-grazing by newly
arrived caribou may rapidly deplete forage on an annual cycle [@Bergerud1990]. Although
unconfirmed, it is also possible that Fogo Island has experienced forage
depletion since the introduction of caribou in the 1960s. More likely, however,
is fine-scale competition for foraging resources that drives caribou to swim to
new islands.

Movement between islands requires caribou to assess the trade-off associated
with swimming. This trade-off can be understood as density-dependent habitat
selection governed by the Ideal Free Distribution [@Morris1987; @Bradbury2015].
Ideal Free Distribution theory predicts a fitness equilibrium: when the density
in a given habitat patch has exceeded the optimum for fitness within that patch,
animals should relocate and settle new habitat patches, so that fitness is equal
across all patches [@Bradbury2015]. Islands act as discrete habitat patches in
this case, but the costs associated with swimming create a trade-off when moving
between patches. For caribou in the Fogo Island archipelago, the role of forage
limitation in animal habitat selection patterns remains unknown, but swimming
between islands may be at least partially governed by density-dependent habitat selection.

In total, 12 of 29 collared female caribou swam between islands in the Fogo
Island archipelago. Only `r n10` of these 12 individuals had more than 10 swimming
events, suggesting that for ~10% of narjed individuals swimming is relatively
common, on average occurring approximately every `r indMean` days during
ice-free seasons. We did not detect any swimming events for the remaining 17
individuals. It remains unclear whether these individuals do not swim, or
whether swimming is rare for most caribou. Overall, there appears to be three
groups of individuals: those that swim often (n = 3, every ~`r indMean` days), those that
swim occasionally (n = 9, every ~`r ind2Mean` days), and those that never swam (n = 17). We are also
unable to draw conclusions about the prevalence of swimming in the ocean by male
caribou: our initial visual observation was of an adult male, but our GPS data
only included females.

<!-- "During the winter, when individuals could theoretically move between islands more easily by walking across ice, XX individuals were observed moving between islands. YY [(a) majority, (b) minority] of these were not detected swimming during the ice-free season and only moved between islands overwinter. This suggests that [(a) moving between islands is a relatively consistent behaviour within individuals, where some caribou refrain from both swimming and walking over ice] / [(b) caribou who avoided swimming between islands would still take advantage of the benefits provided by these patches, but only when travelling to them was less risky and costly] -->

<!-- QW: I'm not sure we need to say the below.. 
JGH - yeah, it's pretty extra I guess. I'm not really a fan of the above para either, it's not very convincing and doesn't add much
It is theoretically possible that these other
females moved rapidly back and forth between islands within the 2 hour fix rate
of our GPS collars, which we would be unable to detect. We consider this highly
unlikely given the range of residency times for caribou on any given island (min
- max: XX - XX). <!--double check-->
<!-- What is the typical residency time? Is this a true statement or am I just making this up? QW: this is something we will look into, I think. -->

Regardless, oceanic swimming is relatively common among a minority of
marked caribou. Of the three collared individuals that swam the most, two were collared on
Western Indian Island and the third was collared on Fogo Island. Inter-island
distances between Western and Eastern Indian Islands, and the smaller islands
around them, are shorter than those between Fogo Island and others (Figure 2).
Individuals that were born on or spend more time on these smaller islands may
swim between them more frequently than animals that spend most of their time on
Fogo Island. The forage limitation hypothesis is generally thought to apply
uniformly across populations, but individual caribou could evaluate the costs
and benefits of swimming to another island differently. It is possible that some
individuals, in our case ~10%, considered swimming to be less costly or
perceived competition or predation more acutely than their conspecifics.

For several decades after their introduction to Fogo Island, the caribou
population did not exceed ~100 individuals [@Bergerud1989, Newfoundland and
Labrador Wildlife Division, unpublished data]. During the 1990s, population
density reached 300 animals and it is unknown when caribou began to occupy other
islands, anecdotal evidence suggests it was during the 1990s. We surmise that as
competition among conspecifics increased along with population size,
density-dependent habitat selection resulted in expansion of the population to
nearby islands. Following Ideal Free Distribution theory, caribou should swim to
new islands when the average fitness of individuals on the starting island
exceeds the density-fitness equilibrium [@Morris1987]. While this is an ultimate
explanation, our data suggest caribou only remain on smaller islands for a few
days at a time, so the fitness equilibrium remains a theoretical construct. More
likely, however, is that fine-scale competition, density-dependent habitat
selection, and forage depletion drives individuals to peridiodically swim
between islands. Given the presumed low density of coyotes on Fogo Island and
the minimal risk they pose, predation risk does not appear to be a major driver
of swimming.

<!-- QW: changed it a bit - how is this? 
JGH: simplified these two para's a bit,
took out most of the predator stuff. I'm a bit confused by the sentence above
citing your 2018 paper, I'm not really sure what it's saying & how it relates to
the rest of the section. there were comments to that effect as well, maybe
expand the end a bit to make it clearer how that relates? -->

Our observations add to the evidence that caribou can, and occasionally do, swim
in the ocean [e.g. @Miller1995; @Miller2002; @Jeffery2007; @Ricca2012]. 
We suggest that swimming is likely more common than previously thought
for caribou living on oceanic islands, and that forage limitation and the
associated density-dependent habitat selection is an ultimate explanation for
this phenomenon. Although our inference is limited to observations, islands
appear to represent discrete foraging patches for terrestrial animals that can
influence fitness via increased foraging opportunities. We also posit that
individuals can vary in their evaluation of costs and benefits of movement
between these habitat patches.

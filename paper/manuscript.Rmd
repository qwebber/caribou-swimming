## Introduction
Caribou (*Rangifer tarandus*) are exceptional swimmers. Ample evidence exists
that caribou swim in streams, rivers, and lakes during migration [@Leblond_2016] 
to avoid predators [@Bergerud_1985] and access islands during calving
(Bergerud et al. 1990). Even for adept swimmers like caribou, the
energetic expenditure of swimming for quadrupedal mammals is
significantly higher than walking or running (Fish 1993), while drowning
is also possible (Miller & Gunn 1985). Despite a large number of coastal and
island caribou herds, only a handful of examples have documented caribou
swimming in the ocean (Table 1).

The Fogo Island archipelago, off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada (49°N, 54°W),
is home to approximately 300 woodland caribou. During routine fieldwork on May
30, 2017, we observed an unmarked adult male caribou swim between Perry and
Eastern Indian Islands (Figure 1), a swim of at least 470 m which took ~9
minutes (~52 m per minute). This observation prompted us to investigate whether
GPS radio-collared caribou in the population (n = 29 adult females) also swam
between islands. Using these remotely sensed relocations, we determined that
this observation was not unique and that several individuals engaged in this
behaviour (details below).
<!--Is it better to just state our results here, or give this sort of teaser? Initially I had "86 events by 3 individuals" here, but then we ignore that for a couple paragraphs of context before getting back into it... which seemed weird--> 

Fogo Island is the largest island in the archipelago (237.71 km^2^), but there
are at least three other large islands: Western Indian (77.6 km2), Eastern
Indian (38.7 km2) and Change (XX km2) Islands, as well as numerous smaller
islands, including Blundon’s (1.18 km2), North Long (1.01 km2), South Long (0.48
km2), Kate’s (1.64 km2), and Brother’s (1.59 km2) Islands (see Figure 1).
Habitats are similar across the archipelago, consisting largely of coniferous
and mixed forests of balsam fir (*Abies balsamea*), black spruce (*Picea
mariana*), and white birch (*Betula papyrifera*) as well as bogs, lakes, lichen
and rocky barrens.

Caribou were introduced to Fogo Island (n = 26 animals between 1964–67) and
Change Island (n = 5 animals in 1964) from the main Island of Newfoundland as
part of a series of translocations and introductions throughout the province
(Bergerud & Mercer 1989). Since 2016 we have been studying the Fogo Island
caribou herd (Bonar et al. 2017; Bonar et al. 2018; Peignier et al. 2019). To
date, we have fitted 29 adult female caribou with GPS collars (1240g, GPS 4400M;
Lotek Wireless Inc., Newmarket, Ontario, Canada), which were programmed to
collect relocation fixes every 2 hours (see Bonar et al. 2018 for details). We
used GPS locations from these individuals to investigate oceanic swimming
events.

We identified swimming events as two consecutive GPS locations from an
individual on different islands. This region typically experiences pack ice
during the winter, so caribou may be able to travel between islands by
walking over the ice. We restricted our GPS data to the ice-free period of the
year (April 1 - November 25) to avoid this possibility. Using these criteria, we
identified three adult female caribou that collectively engaged in 86 swimming
events (Figure 2).

Caribou may swim between islands in the ocean for similar reasons that drive
caribou swimming in freshwater (Leblond et al. 2016). We present two
explanations for these swimming events, forage limitation (Miller 2002) and
predator avoidance (Jeffery et al. 2007), and discuss why these swimming events
appear to be relatively commonplace in the population.

## Forage limitation
Forage limitation and over-grazing is a major concern for caribou populations
(Schaefer et al. 2016; Zamin et al. 2017) and could explain movement between
islands. Conspecific competition for resources driven by reduced foraging
opportunities can decrease reproductive success of adult females (Schaefer et
al. 2016). Forage scarcity has been proposed as a potential reason for caribou
moving between arctic islands on the sea-ice in winter (Miller et al. 1977).
For very small islands, over-grazing by newly arrived caribou may rapidly
deplete forage (Bergerud et al. 1990). Without sea ice, movement from the
mainland to an island, or between islands, requires caribou to assess the
trade-off associated with swimming.

This trade-off can be understood as density-dependent habitat selection governed
by the Ideal Free Distribution (Morris 1987; Bradbury et al. 2015). Ideal Free
Distribution theory predicts a fitness equilibrium: when the density in a given
habitat patch has exceeded the optimum for fitness within that patch, animals
should relocate and settle new habitat patches, so that fitness is equal across
all patches (Bradbury et al. 2015). Islands act as discrete habitat patches in
this case, but the costs associated with swimming create a trade-off when moving
between patches. For caribou in the Fogo Island archipelago, the role of forage
limitation in animal habitat selection patterns and movement remains unknown,
but swimming between islands may in part be explained by forage limitation and
conspecific competition.

## Predator avoidance
Predator avoidance could also contribute to swimming behaviour of caribou
(Miller 2002). During calving, female caribou are known to swim to small islands
in freshwater lakes give birth, or with their calves after birth, to avoid
predation (Bergerud & Page 1987). The use of shoreline habitat in summer is
considered an effective anti-predator calving strategy by allowing for swimming
to islands or peninsulas as a predation avoidance flight response (Bergerud et
al. 1990). The use of water, and by association occasionally swimming, is
therefore part of the fine-scale interactions between caribou and their
predators and the use of islands appears to be an effective anti-predator
strategy.

Historic predators of caribou such as wolves (*Canis lupus*) and black bears
(*Ursus americanus*) are not present in the Fogo Island archipelago; coyotes
(*Canis latrans*) are the top predator in this region. Predation by coyotes on
adult caribou is relatively rare (ref?), so the potential predator effect on
caribou swimming behaviour is likely to be a flight response to non-lethal
encounters. Calves are susceptible to coyotes, particularly young calves, but
the energetic costs to oceanic swimming are likely to be far greater for small
calves.

<!-- did the swimming events occur during the calving season? were these three breeders/non-breeders? did any of these females make these journeys with their calves?  -->

## Individual variation 
Three of 29 GPS-collared female caribou swam between islands in the Fogo
archipelago. These swimming events were relatively frequent, on average occuring
once every 24 days within our date range. However, we identified zero swimming
events for the other 26 collared females. It remains unclear why this behaviour
is seemingly common among 10% of our marked population, while 90% never engaged
in it. Our initial direct observation of swimming was an adult male, but as we
only have GPS data for females, we are unable to make conclusions on the
prevalence of this behaviour among male caribou. It is theoretically possible
that these other females moved rapidly back and forth between islands within the
2 hour fix rate of our GPS collars, which we would be unable to detect. We
consider this highly unlikely given the range of residency times for caribou on
any given island (min - max: XX - XX).
<!-- What is the typical residency time? Is this a true statement or am I just making this up? -->

The two hypotheses presented above are generally thought to apply uniformly
across populations, but individual caribou could evaluate the costs and benefits
of swimming to another island differently. Potentially those three females,
compared to the other 26, considered swimming less costly or perceived
competition or predation to be of greater concern. The individual attributes
that might influence how animals vary in their assessments of these trade-offs
are unknown, and potential predictors such as age or personality traits are
unknown for these caribou.

## Summary and conclusion
For several decades after their introduction to Fogo Island, the caribou
population did not exceed ~100 individuals (Bergerud & Mercer 1989; Newfoundland
and Labrador Wildlife Division, unpublished data). During the 1990s, population
density reached 300 animals and anecdotal evidence suggests that [only then???]
caribou began to occupy other islands in the archipelago. We surmise that as
competition among conspecifics increased along with population size,
density-dependent habitat selection resulted in expansion of the population to
nearby islands. Following Ideal Free Distribution theory, caribou should swim to
new islands when the average fitness of individuals on the starting island
exceeds the density-fitness equilibrium (Morris 1987). While this is an ultimate
explanation to a series of proximate observations, it is possible for
density-dependent habitat selection to operate at such a fine-scale (Webber &
Vander Wal 2018). Evidence from the Sable Island horse (Equus ferus caballus)
system corroborates this hypothesis (van Beest et al. 2014). For horses,
selection for high quality habitat was strongest at low population densities,
but individuals tended to settle in lower quality habitats as population density
increased, following Ideal Free Distribution theory (van Beest et al. 2014).
Predator avoidance can also contribute to caribou swimming behaviour, but in
this situation it seems a less likely explanation given predation is primarily a
concern for young calves, which are the least likely to engage in this costly
behaviour.
<!-- this last bit is sort of me bullshitting, not sure it's actually defensible?-->

Our observations add to the evidence that caribou can, and occasionally do, swim
in the ocean (Table 1). While past observations (e.g. Miller 1995, 2002; Jeffery
et al. 2007; Ricca et al. 2012) have noted the exceptional nature of caribou
swimming in the ocean, we suggest that this behaviour is likely more common than
previously thought for caribou living on oceanic islands. We posit forage
limitation and the associated density-dependent habitat selection is an ultimate
explanation for why caribou swimming in the ocean, with predator avoidance as a
potential proximate explanation. Although our inference is limited to
observations, our observations suggest that islands represent discrete foraging
patches for terrestrial animals that could influence fitness via increased
foraging opportunities and safety from predators. We also suggest that
individuals vary in their evaluation of costs and benefits of movement between
these habitat patches.

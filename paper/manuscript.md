The Fogo Island archipelago, off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada, is
home to approximately 300 woodland caribou. During routine fieldwork on
May 30, 2017, we observed an unmarked adult male caribou swim between
two small islands (Figure 1, see Figure 2 for location), a distance of
at least 470 m which took ~9 minutes (~52 m per minute). This
observation prompted us to investigate whether swimming behaviour was
common among GPS radio-collared caribou in the population (n = 29, for
collaring details see, Peignier et al. 2019). We identified an
individual’s swimming events as two consecutive GPS locations (2-hour
relocation rates) on different islands. Northeastern Newfoundland
typically experiences pack ice during winter and caribou are known
locally to travel between islands by walking over the ice. We restricted
our GPS data to the ice-free period of the year (April 1 to December 31)
and identified 127 swimming events over three years (Figure 2). In
addition to our own visual and remotely sensed observations, residents
of Fogo Island have also reported regularly observing caribou swimming
between islands.

In total, 12 of 29 collared female caribou swam between islands in the
Fogo Island archipelago. Of the caribou that swam, caribou swam on
average approximately 11 (range = 2-34) times per year and remained on
each island for approximately 30 (range = 0-724) days before swimming
again. Based on GPS data to infer swimming, we separated the population
into three apparent groups of individuals: those that swam regularly
between islands (n = 3, every ~15 days); those that rarely engaged in
swimming events (n = 9, every ~ 42 days); and those that never swam (n =
17).

Caribou (*Rangifer tarandus*) are exceptional swimmers. Ample evidence
exists that caribou swim in streams, rivers, and lakes during migration
(Leblond et al. 2016), to avoid predators (Bergerud 1985), and to access
islands during calving (Bergerud et al. 1990). Even for adept swimmers
like caribou, that have hollow hair shafts that aid in flotation, the
energetic expenditure of swimming for quadrupedal mammals is
significantly higher than walking or running, and drowning is also
possible (Miller and Gunn 1985). Despite the abundance of coastal and
island caribou herds, only a handful of studies have documented caribou
swimming in the ocean, and most of these lack observation, but rather
deduce swimming based on presence of caribou on a previously
uninhabitated island (e.g. Miller 1995, 2002, Jeffery et al. 2007, Ricca
et al. 2012). Caribou may swim between islands in the ocean for similar
reasons they swim in freshwater (Leblond et al. 2016), mainly concerning
predator avoidance or to access new habitats. We propose that one such
explanation, the forage limitation hypothesis, is the most likely
explanation for oceanic swimming for caribou that live on islands in the
Fogo Island archipelago.

Caribou were introduced to Fogo Island (n = 26 animals between 1964–67)
and Change Island (n = 5 animals in 1964) from Newfoundland as part of a
series of translocations and introductions throughout the province
(Bergerud and Mercer 1989). Typical caribou predators such as black
bears (*Ursus americanus*) and wolves (*Canis lupus*) are absent from
Fogo Island; the dominant predator is coyote (*Canis latrans*), which
predate calves but it remains unclear what threat they pose, if any, to
adult caribou (Rayl et al. 2014). Given the minimal risk of predation to
adults, we propose that forage limitation is more likely to drive
movement between islands than predator avoidance. For several decades
after their introduction to Fogo Island, the caribou population did not
exceed ~100 individuals (Bergerud and Mercer 1989, Newfoundland and
Labrador Wildlife Division, unpublished data). During the 1990s,
population density reached ~300 animals and anecdotal evidence suggests
caribou were first seen on nearby islands during this same period.
Increased competition for resources on Fogo due to this increase in
density could have precipitated movement to other islands.

Forage limitation and over-grazing is a major concern for caribou
populations and can lead to reduced female reproductive success
(Schaefer et al. 2016). Forage scarcity has been proposed as a potential
reason for caribou moving between arctic islands on the sea-ice in
winter (Miller et al. 1977). For the Fogo Island population, as the
population grew and predation pressure was insufficient to maintain
population density, forage depletion could lead caribou to make similar,
but riskier and more costly, movements between islands during the
ice-free season. Given the small size of other islands near Fogo,
over-grazing by newly arrived caribou could rapidly deplete forage on an
annual cycle (Bergerud et al. 1990), leading to more frequent movements
back and forth between islands rather than permanent relocation.

The trade-off associated with swimming between islands can be understood
as density-dependent habitat selection governed by the Ideal Free
Distribution (Morris 1987, Bradbury et al. 2015). Ideal Free
Distribution theory predicts a fitness equilibrium: when the density in
a given habitat patch has exceeded the optimum for fitness within that
patch, animals should relocate and settle new habitat patches, so that
fitness is equal across all patches (Bradbury et al. 2015). Islands act
as discrete habitat patches in this case, but the costs associated with
swimming create a trade-off when moving between patches. For caribou in
the Fogo Island archipelago, the role of forage limitation in habitat
selection patterns remains unknown, but swimming between islands may be
at least partially governed by density-dependent habitat selection.

Forage limitation may be the ultimate explanation for caribou swimming
between oceanic islands, but a number of proximate mechanisms remain
untested. Our observations of caribou swimming in the ocean lead to five
questions for future research:

1)  How does the energetic cost or risk of swimming differ from walking
    on sea ice? The cost of swimming may be lower than the risk of
    falling through sea ice and drowning, so what proportion of
    inter-island movements are swimming events compared to walking on
    ice? The presence and extent of sea ice varies annually in our study
    area, and although we are unable to determine the exact timing or
    duation of sea ice, we delineate on Figure 2b the timing of typical
    sea ice arrival and departure.

2)  At which temporal and spatial scales do caribou choose to swim
    between islands? Does the time of day, weather, season, or
    availability of food influence swimming?

3)  Does reproductive status (presence of a calf-at-heel) or demographic
    class (age, sex) influence propensity for oceanic swimming? Our
    initial observation was of an adult male, but all collared
    individuals were adult females. Are younger caribou more likely to
    swim due to heightened competition? Are males more likely to swim in
    the summer given the are not restricted based on presence of a
    calf-at-heel, as females are.

4)  If swimming is a function of density-dependent habitat selection,
    what are the costs of movement between patches? IFD assumes
    zero-cost movement, but could the risk and energetic costs
    associated with oceanic swimming be estimated using the potential
    fitness deficit that caribou are willing to tolerate before swimming
    to a new island?

5)  In relation to all the previous questions: how do individuals vary
    in their assessment of the costs and benefits of swimming between
    islands? Why did some caribou regularly engage in swimming events,
    while more than half of our marked population were never observed
    swimming in the ocean? The forage limitation hypothesis is thought
    to apply uniformly across populations, but individual caribou could
    evaluate the costs and benefits of swimming to another island
    differently. It is possible that some individuals, in our case ~10%,
    considered swimming to be less costly or perceived competition or
    predation more acutely than their conspecifics.

We surmise that for Fogo Island, as competition among conspecifics
increased along with population size, density-dependent habitat
selection resulted in expansion of the population to nearby islands.
Following Ideal Free Distribution theory, caribou should swim to new
islands when the average fitness of individuals on the starting island
exceeds the density-fitness equilibrium (Morris 1987). While this is an
ultimate explanation, our data suggest caribou only remain on smaller
islands for a few days at a time, so the fitness equilibrium remains a
theoretical construct. More likely, however, is that fine-scale
competition, density-dependent habitat selection, and forage depletion
drives individuals to periodically swim between islands. Our focal
observations add to the evidence that caribou can, and occasionally do,
swim in the ocean (e.g. Miller 1995, 2002, Jeffery et al. 2007, Ricca et
al. 2012). We suggest that swimming is likely more common than
previously thought for caribou living on oceanic islands, and that
forage limitation and the associated density-dependent habitat selection
is an ultimate explanation for this phenomenon. Although our inference
is limited to observations, islands appear to represent discrete
foraging patches for terrestrial animals that can influence fitness via
increased foraging opportunities. We also present several hypotheses
related to the nuances and further variation within the idea that
density-dependent habitat selection governs swimming behaviour, and
posit that above and beyond these additional factors, individuals can
vary in their evaluation of costs and benefits of movement between these
habitat patches.

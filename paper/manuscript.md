## Introduction

Caribou (*Rangifer tarandus*) are exceptional swimmers. Ample evidence
exists that caribou swim in streams, rivers, and lakes during migration
(Leblond, St-Laurent, and ’e 2016) to avoid predators (Bergerud 1985)
and access islands during calving (Bergerud, Ferguson, and Butler 1990).
Even for adept swimmers like caribou, the energetic expenditure of
swimming for quadrupedal mammals is significantly higher than walking or
running (Fish 1993), while drowning is also possible (Miller and Gunn
1986). Despite a large number of coastal and island caribou herds, only
a handful of examples have documented caribou swimming in the ocean
(Table 1).

The Fogo Island archipelago, off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada, is
home to approximately 300 woodland caribou. During routine fieldwork on
May 30, 2017, we observed an unmarked adult male caribou swim between
Wester and Eastern Indian Islands (Figure 1), a swim of at least 470 m
which took ~9 minutes (~52 m per minute). This observation prompted us
to investigate whether swimming behaviour was common among GPS
radio-collared caribou in the population (n = 29 adult females: 1240g,
GPS 4400M; Lotek Wireless Inc., Newmarket, Ontario, Canada). We
identified swimming events when two consecutive GPS (2-hour relocation
rates) locations from an individual occurred on different islands. This
region typically experiences pack ice during the winter, so caribou may
be able to travel between islands by walking over the ice. We restricted
our GPS data to the ice-free period of the year (April 1 - November 25)
and we identified three adult female caribou that collectively engaged
in 86 swimming events (Figure 2).

In total,
<!--Is it better to just state our results here, or give this sort of teaser? Initially I had "86 events by 3 individuals" here, but then we ignore that for a couple paragraphs of context before getting back into it... which seemed weird-->

<!-- Caribou were introduced to Fogo Island (n = 26 animals between 1964–67) and
Change Island (n = 5 animals in 1964) from the main Island of Newfoundland as
part of a series of translocations and introductions throughout the province
(Bergerud & Mercer 1989). Since 2016 we have been studying the Fogo Island
caribou herd (Bonar et al. 2017; Bonar et al. 2018; Peignier et al. 2019). To
date, we have fitted 29 adult female caribou with GPS collars (1240g, GPS 4400M;
Lotek Wireless Inc., Newmarket, Ontario, Canada), which were programmed to
collect relocation fixes every 2 hours (see Bonar et al. 2018 for details). We
used GPS locations from these individuals to investigate oceanic swimming
events. -->

Fogo Island is the largest island in the archipelago (237.71
km<sup>2</sup>), but there are at least three other large islands:
Western Indian (77.6 km2), Eastern Indian (38.7 km2) and Change (XX km2)
Islands, as well as numerous smaller islands, including Blundon’s (1.18
km2), North Long (1.01 km2), South Long (0.48 km2), Kate’s (1.64 km2),
and Brother’s (1.59 km2) Islands (see Figure 1). Habitats are similar
across the archipelago, consisting largely of coniferous and mixed
forests of balsam fir (*Abies balsamea*), black spruce (*Picea
mariana*), and white birch (*Betula papyrifera*) as well as bogs, lakes,
lichen and rocky barrens.

Caribou may swim between islands in the ocean for similar reasons that
drive caribou swimming in freshwater (Leblond, St-Laurent, and ’e 2016).
We present two explanations for these swimming events, forage limitation
(Miller 2002) and predator avoidance
(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Jeffrey_2007">**???**</span>),
and discuss why these swimming events appear to be relatively
commonplace in the population.

## Forage limitation

Forage limitation and over-grazing is a major concern for caribou
populations (Schaefer et al. 2015) and could explain movement between
islands. Conspecific competition for resources driven by reduced
foraging opportunities can decrease reproductive success of adult
females (Schaefer et al. 2015). Forage scarcity has been proposed as a
potential reason for caribou moving between arctic islands on the
sea-ice in winter (Miller, Russell, and Gunn 1977). For very small
islands, over-grazing by newly arrived caribou may rapidly deplete
forage (Bergerud, Ferguson, and Butler 1990). Without sea ice, movement
from the mainland to an island, or between islands, requires caribou to
assess the trade-off associated with swimming.

This trade-off can be understood as density-dependent habitat selection
governed by the Ideal Free Distribution (Morris 1987; Bradbury,
Vehrencamp, and Clifton 2015). Ideal Free Distribution theory predicts a
fitness equilibrium: when the density in a given habitat patch has
exceeded the optimum for fitness within that patch, animals should
relocate and settle new habitat patches, so that fitness is equal across
all patches (Bradbury, Vehrencamp, and Clifton 2015). Islands act as
discrete habitat patches in this case, but the costs associated with
swimming create a trade-off when moving between patches. For caribou in
the Fogo Island archipelago, the role of forage limitation in animal
habitat selection patterns remains unknown, but swimming between islands
may in part be explained by forage limitation and conspecific
competition.

## Predator avoidance

Predator avoidance could also contribute to swimming behaviour of
caribou (Miller 2002) <!-- find doi for this article -->. During
calving, female caribou are known to swim to small islands in freshwater
lakes give birth, or with their calves after birth, to avoid predation
(Bergerud and Page 1987). The use of shoreline habitat in summer is
considered an effective anti-predator calving strategy by allowing for
swimming to islands or peninsulas as a predation avoidance flight
response (Bergerud, Ferguson, and Butler 1990). The use of water, and by
association occasionally swimming, is therefore part of the fine-scale
interactions between caribou and their predators and the use of islands
appears to be an effective anti-predator strategy.

Historic predators of caribou such as wolves (*Canis lupus*) and black
bears (*Ursus americanus*) are not present in the Fogo Island
archipelago; coyotes (*Canis latrans*) are the top predator in this
region. Predation by coyotes on adult caribou is relatively rare (ref?),
so the potential effect of predators on caribou swimming behaviour is
likely to be a flight response to non-lethal encounters. Calves are
susceptible to coyotes, particularly young calves, but the energetic
costs to oceanic swimming for calves is likely to be far greater for
small calves compared to
adults.

<!-- did the swimming events occur during the calving season? were these three breeders/non-breeders? did any of these females make these journeys with their calves?  -->

## Individual variation

In total, 3 of 29 collared female caribou swam between islands in the
Fogo archipelago. These swimming events were relatively frequent, on
average occuring once every 24 <!--double check--> days during ice-free
seasons. However, despite relatively frequent swimming events for these
three individuals, we were unable to identify any swimming events for
the other 26 collared females. It remains unclear why ocean swimming is
relatively common among ~10% of our marked population, while the other
90% never swam. Of the three collared individuals, two were collared on
Western Indian Island and the third was collared on Fogo Island. It is
possible that individuals born on, or that live on, Eastern and Western
Indian Island swim are more likely to swim between islands because
inter-island distances are shorter than between Western Indian and Fogo
Islands (Figure 2). Furthermore, it is unclear whether swimming is more
common among males or females. Our initial observation was of an adult
male, but our GPS data only includes females.
<!-- QW: I'm not sure we need to say this.. 
It is theoretically possible that these other
females moved rapidly back and forth between islands within the 2 hour fix rate
of our GPS collars, which we would be unable to detect. We consider this highly
unlikely given the range of residency times for caribou on any given island (min
- max: XX - XX). <!--double check-->
<!-- What is the typical residency time? Is this a true statement or am I just making this up? QW: this is something we will look into, I think. -->

The forage limitation and predator avoidance hypotheses are generally
thought to apply uniformly across populations, but individual caribou
could evaluate the costs and benefits of swimming to another island
differently. It is possible that some individuals, in our case ~10%,
considered swimming less costly or that they perceived competition or
predation more acutely than their conspecifics. Intrinsic life-history,
physiological, or behavioural traits that might influence how animals
vary in their assessments of swimming trade-offs remains unknown. Future
work could assess the role of age, stress, or an individuals tendency to
move potential predictors of swimming behaviour.

## Summary and conclusion

For several decades after their introduction to Fogo Island, the caribou
population did not exceed ~100 individuals (Bergerud & Mercer 1989;
Newfoundland and Labrador Wildlife Division, unpublished data). During
the 1990s, population density reached 300 animals and anecdotal evidence
suggests that \[only then???\] caribou began to occupy other islands in
the archipelago. We surmise that as competition among conspecifics
increased along with population size, density-dependent habitat
selection resulted in expansion of the population to nearby islands.
Following Ideal Free Distribution theory, caribou should swim to new
islands when the average fitness of individuals on the starting island
exceeds the density-fitness equilibrium (Morris 1987). While this is an
ultimate explanation to a series of proximate observations, fine-scale
density-dependent habitat selection is theoretically possible (Webber
and Wal 2017). For horses (*Equus ferus caballus*), selection for high
quality habitat was strongest at low population densities, but
individuals tended to settle in lower quality habitats as population
density increased, following Ideal Free Distribution theory (van Beest
et al. 2013). Predator avoidance could also contribute to caribou
swimming behaviour, but given the presumed low density of coyotes on
Fogo Island and that predation primarily only affects young calves, we
suspect predator is a possible, but less likely explanation.
<!-- this last bit is sort of me bullshitting, not sure it's actually defensible? 
QW: changed it a bit -->

Our observations add to the evidence that caribou can, and occasionally
do, swim in the ocean (Table 1). While past observations (e.g.
(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Miller_1995">**???**</span>);
(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Jeffrey_2007">**???**</span>);
Ricca et al. (2012)\] have noted the exceptional nature of caribou
swimming in the ocean, we suggest that this behaviour is likely more
common than previously thought for caribou living on oceanic islands. We
posit forage limitation and the associated density-dependent habitat
selection is an ultimate explanation for why caribou swimming in the
ocean, with predator avoidance as a potential proximate explanation.
Although our inference is limited to observations, our observations
suggest that islands represent discrete foraging patches for terrestrial
animals that could influence fitness via increased foraging
opportunities and safety from predators. We also suggest that
individuals vary in their evaluation of costs and benefits of movement
between these habitat patches.

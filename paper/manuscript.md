The Fogo Island archipelago, off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada, is
home to approximately 300 woodland caribou. During routine fieldwork on
May 30, 2017, we observed an unmarked adult male caribou swim between
two small islands (Figure 1 & 2), a distance of at least 470 m which
took ~9 minutes (~52 m per minute). Residents of Fogo Island confirmed
this phenomenon and have also reported regularly observing caribou
swimming between islands. This observation prompted us to investigate
whether swimming behaviour was common among GPS radio-collared caribou
in the population (n = 29, for collaring details see, Peignier et al.
2019). We identified an individual’s swimming events as two consecutive
GPS locations (2-hour relocation rates) on different islands.
Newfoundland typically experiences pack ice in late winter and caribou
,may travel between islands by walking over the ice. To identify
swimming events, we restricted our dataset between April 1 and December
31 and identified 127 swimming events over three years (Figure 2). Given
the prevalence of swimming in this population, we discuss the causes and
consequences of this behaviour and propose future areas of research.

In total, 12 of 29 collared female caribou swam between islands in the
Fogo Island archipelago. Of the caribou that swam, caribou swam on
average approximately 11 (range = 2-34) times per year and remained on
each island for approximately 30 (range = 0-724) days before swimming
again. Based on GPS data to infer swimming, we separated the population
into three apparent groups of individuals: those that swam regularly
between islands (n = 3, every ~15 days); those that rarely engaged in
swimming events (n = 9, every ~ 42 days); and those that never swam (n =
17).

Caribou (*Rangifer tarandus*) are exceptional swimmers. Ample evidence
exists that caribou swim in streams, rivers, and lakes during migration
(Leblond et al. 2016), to avoid predators (Bergerud 1985), and to access
islands during calving (Bergerud et al. 1990). Even for adept swimmers
like caribou, which have hollow hair shafts that aid in flotation, the
energetic expenditure of swimming for quadrupedal mammals is
significantly higher than walking or running, and drowning is also
possible (Miller and Gunn 1985). Despite the abundance of coastal and
island caribou herds, only a few studies have documented caribou
swimming in the ocean, and most of these lack observation, but rather
deduce swimming based on presence of caribou on a previously
uninhabitated island (e.g. Miller 1995, 2002, Jeffery et al. 2007, Ricca
et al. 2012). Caribou may swim between islands in the ocean for similar
reasons they swim in freshwater (Leblond et al. 2016), mainly concerning
predator avoidance or to access new habitats and foraging opportunities.
We propose that one such explanation, the forage limitation hypothesis,
is the most likely explanation for oceanic swimming for caribou that
live on islands in the Fogo Island archipelago.

Caribou were introduced to Fogo Island between 1964–67 as part of a
series of translocations throughout the province (Bergerud and Mercer
1989). Typical caribou predators such as black bears (*Ursus
americanus*) and wolves (*Canis lupus*) are absent from Fogo Island; the
dominant predator is coyote (*Canis latrans*), which predate calves but
it remains unclear what threat they pose, if any, to adult caribou (Rayl
et al. 2014). Given the minimal risk of predation to adults and low
density of coyote on Fogo Island, we propose that forage limitation is
more likely to drive movement between islands than predator avoidance.
For several decades after their introduction to Fogo Island, the caribou
population did not exceed ~100 individuals (Bergerud and Mercer 1989,
Newfoundland and Labrador Wildlife Division, unpublished data). During
the 1990s, population density reached ~300 animals and anecdotal
evidence suggests caribou were first seen on nearby islands during this
same period. Increased competition for resources on Fogo Island due to
this increase in density could have precipitated movement to other
islands.

Forage limitation and over-grazing is a major concern for caribou
populations and can lead to reduced female reproductive success
(Schaefer et al. 2016). Forage scarcity has been proposed as a potential
reason for caribou moving between arctic islands on the sea-ice in
winter (Miller et al. 1977). For the Fogo Island population, as the
population grew and predation pressure was insufficient to maintain
population density, forage depletion could lead caribou to make similar,
but riskier and more costly, movements between islands during the
ice-free season. Given the small size of other islands near Fogo (Figure
2), over-grazing by newly arrived caribou could rapidly deplete forage
on an annual cycle (Bergerud et al. 1990), leading to more frequent
movements back and forth between islands rather than permanent
relocation.

The trade-off associated with swimming between islands can be understood
as density-dependent habitat selection governed by the Ideal Free
Distribution (Morris 1987). Ideal Free Distribution theory predicts a
fitness equilibrium: when the density in a given habitat patch has
exceeded the optimum for fitness within that patch, animals should
relocate and settle new habitat patches, so that fitness is equal across
all patches (Morris 1987). Islands act as discrete habitat patches in
this case, but the costs associated with swimming create a trade-off
when moving between patches. For caribou in the Fogo Island archipelago,
the role of forage limitation in habitat selection patterns remains
unknown, but swimming between islands may be at least partially governed
by density-dependent habitat selection.

Forage limitation may be the ultimate explanation for caribou swimming
between oceanic islands, but a number of proximate mechanisms remain
untested. Our observations of caribou swimming in the ocean lead to five
questions for future research:
<!-- a) For the questions that arise, maybe try to generalize the language a bit
so that they are a bit broader: caribou as model, but emphasize the
ecological/evolutionary process it will comment on. 
b.) Consider tweaking the
intro the the questions less as 'someone could do this' as something along the
lines of : this has ignited in us the idea that we can tailor our data
collection in our closely studies system to access some of these questions. -->

1)  How do energetic costs and risks of swimming differ from walking on
    sea ice? Walking over ice is less energetically expensive than
    swimming, but may pose a greater risk of mortality from falling
    through the ice. Although the presence and extent of sea ice varies
    annually, we deduce that although the majority of inter-island
    movements occur between April 1 and December 31, some inter-island
    movements appear to be caribou walking on sea ice between islands
    (Figure 2B). Our aim for future research on the trade-offs of these
    types of movement considers how the costs, e.g. energy expenditure
    or mortality, and benefits, e.g. novel foraging opportunities, may
    vary seasonally.

<!--2) At which temporal and spatial scales do caribou choose to swim
between islands? Does the time of day, weather, season, or availability
of food influence swimming?-->

<!--3) Does reproductive status (presence of a calf-at-heel) or demographic class
(age or sex) influence propensity for oceanic swimming? Our initial observation
was of an adult male, but all collared individuals were adult females. Are
younger caribou more likely to swim if they are unable to compete with older
individuals for resources? Are males or females without a calf-at-heel more
likely to swim in the summer given they are not restricted based on presence of
a calf-at-heel, as females are? -->

2)  If swimming is a function of density-dependent habitat selection,
    what are the costs of movement between patches? IFD assumes
    zero-cost movement, but could the risk and energetic costs
    associated with oceanic swimming be estimated using the potential
    fitness deficit that caribou are willing to tolerate before swimming
    to a new island?

3)  In relation to questions 1 and 2: how do individuals vary in their
    propensity to swim and their assessment of the costs and benefits of
    swimming between islands? We observed some individuals that
    regularly engaged in swimming events, while others were never
    observed swimming in the ocean? Our existing research on individual
    behavioural variation in caribou movement ecology \]Webber et al.
    (2020)\] provides a basis to investigate the role of inherent
    individual differences in swimming behaviour. Specifically, the
    forage limitation hypothesis applies uniformly across populations,
    but individuals could evaluate the costs and benefits of swimming
    differently.

We surmise that for Fogo Island, as competition among conspecifics
increased along with population size, density-dependent habitat
selection resulted in expansion of the population to nearby islands.
Following Ideal Free Distribution theory, caribou should swim to new
islands when the average fitness of individuals on the starting island
exceeds the density-fitness equilibrium (Morris 1987). While this is an
ultimate explanation, our data suggest caribou only remain on smaller
islands for a few days at a time, so the fitness equilibrium remains a
theoretical construct. More likely, however, is that fine-scale
competition, density-dependent habitat selection, and forage depletion
drives individuals to periodically swim between islands. Our focal
observations add to the evidence that caribou can, and occasionally do,
swim in the ocean (e.g. Miller 1995, 2002, Jeffery et al. 2007, Ricca et
al. 2012). We suggest that swimming is likely more common than
previously thought for caribou living on oceanic islands, and that
forage limitation and the associated density-dependent habitat selection
is an ultimate explanation for this phenomenon. Although our inference
is limited to observations, islands appear to represent discrete
foraging patches for terrestrial animals that can influence fitness via
increased foraging opportunities. We also present several hypotheses
related to the nuances and further variation within the idea that
density-dependent habitat selection governs swimming behaviour, and
posit that above and beyond these additional factors, individuals can
vary in their evaluation of costs and benefits of movement between these
habitat patches.

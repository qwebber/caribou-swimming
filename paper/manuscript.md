# Introduction

Caribou (*Rangifer tarandus*) are exceptional swimmers. Ample evidence
exists that caribou swim in streams, rivers, and lakes during migration
(Leblond, St-Laurent, and Côté 2016), to avoid predators (Bergerud
1985), and access islands during calving (Bergerud, Ferguson, and Butler
1990). Even for adept swimmers like caribou, the energetic expenditure
of swimming for quadrupedal mammals is significantly higher than walking
or running <!--[@Fish1993]-->, while drowning is also possible (Miller
and Gunn 1985). Despite a large number of coastal and island caribou
herds, only a handful of examples have documented caribou swimming in
the ocean (e.g. Miller 1995, 2002; Jeffery, Otto, and Phillips 2007;
Ricca et al. 2012).

The Fogo Island archipelago, off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada, is
home to approximately 300 woodland caribou. During routine fieldwork on
May 30, 2017, we observed an unmarked adult male caribou swim between
Western and Eastern Indian Islands (Figure 1), a swim of at least 470 m
which took ~9 minutes (~52 m per minute). This observation prompted us
to investigate whether swimming behaviour was common among GPS
radio-collared caribou in the population (n = 29 adult females; 1240g,
GPS 4400M; Lotek Wireless Inc., Newmarket, Ontario, Canada). We
identified swimming events as two consecutive GPS (2-hour relocation
rates) locations from an individual occurred on different islands.
Northeastern Newfoundland typically experiences pack ice during winter
and caribou are known locally to travel between islands by walking over
the ice. We restricted our GPS data to the ice-free period of the year
(April 1 - November 25) and we identified three adult female caribou
that collectively had 86 swimming events (Figure 2). In addition to our
own visual and remotely sensed observations, residents of Fogo Island
have also reported observing caribou swimming between islands on
numerous occaisions.

In total, these 86 swimming events occured in month (n = Y), month (n =
Y), and month (n = Y), while the remaining events were in month, month,
and month (n = Y). On average, caribou swam between islands
approximately ever 24 days, but some individuals swam up to XX times per
week/month/whatever. <!--Is it better
to just state our results here, or give this sort of teaser? Initially I had "86
events by 3 individuals" here, but then we ignore that for a couple paragraphs
of context before getting back into it... which seemed weird-->

<!-- Caribou were introduced to Fogo Island (n = 26 animals between 1964–67) and
Change Island (n = 5 animals in 1964) from the main Island of Newfoundland as
part of a series of translocations and introductions throughout the province
(Bergerud & Mercer 1989).

<!-- still not sure we need this paragraph, I wonder if the island size
information could be included in the figure caption?-->

Fogo Island is the largest island in the archipelago (237.71
km<sup>2</sup>), but there are at least three other large islands:
Western Indian (77.6 km2), Eastern Indian (38.7 km2) and Change (XX km2)
Islands, as well as numerous smaller islands, including Blundon’s (1.18
km2), North Long (1.01 km2), South Long (0.48 km2), Kate’s (1.64 km2),
and Brother’s (1.59 km2) Islands (see Figure 1). Habitats are similar
across the archipelago, consisting largely of coniferous and mixed
forests of balsam fir (*Abies balsamea*), black spruce (*Picea
mariana*), and white birch (*Betula papyrifera*) as well as bogs, lakes,
lichen and rocky barrens.

Caribou may swim between islands in the ocean for similar reasons that
drive caribou swimming in freshwater (Leblond, St-Laurent, and Côté
2016). We present two explanations for these swimming events, forage
limitation (Miller 2002) and predator avoidance (Jeffery, Otto, and
Phillips 2007), and discuss why these swimming events appear to be
relatively commonplace in the population.

# Forage limitation

Forage limitation and over-grazing is a major concern for caribou
populations (Schaefer et al. 2016) and could explain movement between
islands. Conspecific competition for resources driven by reduced
foraging opportunities can decrease reproductive success of adult
females (Schaefer et al. 2016). Forage scarcity has been proposed as a
potential reason for caribou moving between arctic islands on the
sea-ice in winter (Miller, Russell, and Gunn 1977). For very small
islands, over-grazing by newly arrived caribou may rapidly deplete
forage (Bergerud, Ferguson, and Butler 1990). Without sea ice, movement
from the mainland to an island, or between islands, requires caribou to
assess the trade-off associated with swimming.

This trade-off can be understood as density-dependent habitat selection
governed by the Ideal Free Distribution (Morris 1987; Bradbury,
Vehrencamp, and Clifton 2015). Ideal Free Distribution theory predicts a
fitness equilibrium: when the density in a given habitat patch has
exceeded the optimum for fitness within that patch, animals should
relocate and settle new habitat patches, so that fitness is equal across
all patches (Bradbury, Vehrencamp, and Clifton 2015). Islands act as
discrete habitat patches in this case, but the costs associated with
swimming create a trade-off when moving between patches. For caribou in
the Fogo Island archipelago, the role of forage limitation in animal
habitat selection patterns remains unknown, but swimming between islands
may in part be explained by forage limitation and conspecific
competition.

# Predator avoidance

Predator avoidance could also contribute to swimming behaviour of
caribou (Miller 2002). During calving, female caribou are known to swim
to small islands in freshwater lakes and give birth, or with their
calves after birth, to avoid predation (Bergerud 1985). The use of
shoreline habitat in summer is considered an effective anti-predator
calving strategy by allowing for swimming to islands or peninsulas as a
predation avoidance flight response (Bergerud, Ferguson, and Butler
1990). The use of water, and by association occasionally swimming, is
therefore part of the fine-scale interactions between caribou and their
predators and the use of islands appears to be an effective
anti-predator strategy.

Historic predators of caribou such as wolves (*Canis lupus*) and black
bears (*Ursus americanus*) are not present in the Fogo Island
archipelago, thus leaving coyotes (*Canis latrans*) as the top predator.
Predation by coyotes on adult caribou is relatively rare
(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="BastilleRousseau2016">**???**</span>),
so the potential effect of predators on caribou swimming behaviour is
limited to non-consumptive effects associated with encounters and
subsequent flight response. Adult females with calves at heel may be an
exception because calves are highly susceptible to coyotes (Rayl et al.
2014), but the energetic costs for calves to swim in the ocean is likely
far greater than adults. As one might expect, none <!--confirm--> of the
86 swimming events we observed occurred in the weeks after calves were
born, suggesting swimming with in the ocean with a calf-at-heel is
likely more risky than other predator avoidance
behaviours.

<!-- did the swimming events occur during the calving season? were these three breeders/non-breeders? did any of these females make these journeys with their calves?  -->

# Individual variation

In total, 3 of 29 collared female caribou swam between islands in the
Fogo archipelago. These swimming events were relatively frequent, on
average occuring once every 24 <!--double check--> days during ice-free
seasons. However, despite relatively frequent swimming events for these
three individuals, we were unable to identify any swimming events for
the other 26 collared females. It remains unclear why ocean swimming is
relatively common among ~10% of our marked population, while the other
90% never swam. Of the three collared individuals, two were collared on
Western Indian Island and the third was collared on Fogo Island. It is
possible that individuals born on, or that live on, Eastern and Western
Indian Island swim are more likely to swim between islands because
inter-island distances are shorter than between Western Indian and Fogo
Islands (Figure 2). Furthermore, it is unclear whether swimming is more
common among males or females. Our initial observation was of an adult
male, but our GPS data only includes females.
<!-- QW: not sure how to finish this off -->
<!-- QW: I'm not sure we need to say this.. 
It is theoretically possible that these other
females moved rapidly back and forth between islands within the 2 hour fix rate
of our GPS collars, which we would be unable to detect. We consider this highly
unlikely given the range of residency times for caribou on any given island (min
- max: XX - XX). <!--double check-->
<!-- What is the typical residency time? Is this a true statement or am I just making this up? QW: this is something we will look into, I think. -->

The forage limitation and predator avoidance hypotheses are generally
thought to apply uniformly across populations, but individual caribou
could evaluate the costs and benefits of swimming to another island
differently. It is possible that some individuals, in our case ~10%,
considered swimming less costly or that they perceived competition or
predation more acutely than their conspecifics. Intrinsic life-history,
physiological, or behavioural traits that might influence how animals
vary in their assessments of swimming trade-offs remains unknown. Future
work could assess the role of age, stress, or an individuals tendency to
move potential predictors of swimming behaviour.

# Summary and conclusion

For several decades after their introduction to Fogo Island, the caribou
population did not exceed ~100 individuals \[Bergerud and Mercer (1989)
; Newfoundland and Labrador Wildlife Division, unpublished data). During
the 1990s, population density reached 300 animals and anecdotal evidence
suggests that \[only then???\] caribou began to occupy other islands in
the archipelago. We surmise that as competition among conspecifics
increased along with population size, density-dependent habitat
selection resulted in expansion of the population to nearby islands.
Following Ideal Free Distribution theory, caribou should swim to new
islands when the average fitness of individuals on the starting island
exceeds the density-fitness equilibrium (Morris 1987). While this is an
ultimate explanation to a series of proximate observations, fine-scale
density-dependent habitat selection is theoretically possible (Webber
and Vander Wal 2018). Predator avoidance could also contribute to
caribou swimming behaviour, but given the presumed low density of
coyotes on Fogo Island and that predation primarily only affects young
calves, we suspect predator is a possible, but less likely explanation.
<!-- this last bit is sort of me bullshitting, not sure it's actually defensible? 
QW: changed it a bit -->

Our observations add to the evidence that caribou can, and occasionally
do, swim in the ocean (e.g. Miller 1995, 2002; Jeffery, Otto, and
Phillips 2007; Ricca et al. 2012). Taken together, we suggest that
swimming is likely more common than previously thought for caribou
living on oceanic islands. We posit forage limitation and the associated
density-dependent habitat selection is an ultimate explanation for why
caribou swimming in the ocean, with predator avoidance as a potential
proximate explanation. Although our inference is limited to
observations, our observations suggest that islands represent discrete
foraging patches for terrestrial animals that could influence fitness
via increased foraging opportunities and safety from predators. We also
suggest that individuals vary in their evaluation of costs and benefits
of movement between these habitat patches.

On the marginal value of swimming in woodland caribou
================

Movement is costly. Even for adept swimmers like caribou (*Rangifer
tarandus*), which have hollow hair shafts that aid in flotation, the
energetic expenditure of swimming for terrestrial mammals is markedly
higher than walking or running (Miller and Gunn 1985). The drivers that
promote the decision to swim for terrestrial mammals, like caribou, are
often related to the profitability of forage (Miller et al. 1977) and
the risks of predation (Jeffery et al. 2007, Jordan et al. 2010). The
Fogo Island archipelago, off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada, is home
to approximately 300 woodland caribou, descendants of 26 individuals
introduced from the Island of Newfoundland to Fogo Island between
1964–67 (Bergerud and Mercer 1989). During fieldwork on May 30, 2017, we
observed an unmarked adult male caribou swim between two smaller islands
(Figure 1), a distance of 470 m which took approximately 9 minutes.
Given that swimming is energetically expensive, we ask how often do
caribou swim between islands, how long do they occupy islands, and
ultimately what motivates swimming? Here, we frame swimming and island
residency as a model of patch use as described by the marginal value
theorem (Charnov 1976) within the context of the forage limitation
hypothesis. For caribou, the forage limitation hypothesis refers to the
constraints on food availability associated with changes in abundance
(Klein 1991, Schaefer et al. 2016). Here, we integrate our understanding
of forage limitation in caribou populations by using island residency as
a proxy for time in a patch and island size as a proxy for energy intake
in a patch (Figure 2).

Forage limitation and over-grazing can reduce reproductive success of
female caribou (Klein 1991, Schaefer et al. 2016). Forage scarcity has
been proposed as a potential reason for caribou moving between arctic
islands on the sea-ice in winter (Miller et al. 1977). We submit that
testing the marginal value theorem could improve our understanding of
forage limitation. The marginal value theorem posits that animals will
forage optimally by depleting the resources in a given patch
(i.e. island) before moving to a new patch (Charnov 1976). Depletion of
resources on small islands could therefore mirror patterns of
over-grazing and forage limitation that occur for caribou herds at
higher densities in Newfoundland (Schaefer et al. 2016) and elsewhere in
their range (Klein 1991).

Our focus on forage is due to the limited presence of predators in our
system. Throughout their range, wolves (*Canis lupus*) are the primary
predator of caribou. Because there are no wolves on the Island of
Newfoundland, coyotes (*Canis latrans*) and black bears (*Ursus
americanus*) are the majors predator of caribou (Lewis and Mahoney
2014). Within the Fogo Island archipelago there are no black bears and
coyotes exist at low density (Huang et al. 2021), while the probability
of coyote occurrence decreases on the smaller islands. The low density
of predators throughout the archipelago is therefore an unlikely driver
of swimming in our system, though predation may still influence swimming
behaviour for caribou elsewhere in their range (e.g. Jeffery et
al. 2007).

We identified swimming events as two consecutive GPS locations (2-hour
relocation rates) on different islands (n = 29, for collaring details
see Peignier et al. 2019). Newfoundland typically experiences pack ice
in late winter and caribou may travel between islands by walking over
the ice. We restricted our dataset between April 1 and December 31 to
distinguish swimming from walking on ice. We calculated island residency
as the duration of time, measured on 2-hour relocation rates, an
individual caribou was observed on an island. Residency was therefore a
proxy for when the benefits of foraging no longer exceeded the costs of
swimming between islands. Our test of the marginal value theorem for the
case of oceanic swimming by caribou is based on three assumptions: (1)
resources are proportional to the size of each island above
approximately 0.1km2; (2) caribou know the approximate value of the
resources on an island before they swim to and from that island; and (3)
the cost of swimming to and from an island is less than the value of
resources on that island when the caribou departs. Should these
assumptions hold, we would predict a positive relationship where caribou
depart smaller islands sooner than larger islands.

Swimming behavior was common among GPS radio-collared caribou in the
population (n = 29, for collaring details see Peignier et al. 2019). We
identified 127 swimming events over three years (Figure 2). In total, 13
of 29 collared female caribou swam among islands (Figure 2). Of the
caribou that swam, caribou swam on average approximately 3 (range =
2-`neventidMax`) times per year and remained on each island for a median
of 30 (range = 0-724) days before swimming again. We found that caribou
residency increased proportionally with the size of the island for
islands larger than approximately 0.1 km^2, such that caribou spent less
time on smaller islands and more time on larger islands, providing
preliminary evidence for links between forage limitation and the
marginal value theorem (Figure 2B). In many cases, the smaller islands
in the archipelago are forage limited and the larger islands provide
greater opportunities to forage.

The apparent relationship between island size and residency creates a
framework to test our assumptions about the marginal value of resource
use by caribou. We extend this framework to test prospective mechanisms
that drive movement by caribou more generally, and swimming
specifically. For example: 1) If caribou assess the relative value of
resources in a patch, or on an island, we predict that residency should
increase as the value of resources elsewhere becomes depressed. Longer
relative residency might be an indicator of forage limitation and
variation in residency could be a predictor of fitness costs and reduced
reproductive success. 2) Density-dependent habitat selection (Fretwell
and Lucas 1969, Morris 2003) could be invoked to explain what drives
caribou to swim and expand their ranges to include smaller islands. As
caribou density increases on larger islands, competition for resources
increases such that animals may have similar fitness benefits by
selecting islands that at lower density would not be as profitable. At
high local density, individual residency may decrease, thus, increasing
the frequency of swimming. As such, density-dependent habitat selection
may represent an ultimate explanation for why caribou swim between
islands. 3) Cognition is an important proximate mechanism that drives
swimming behaviour. For example, caribou primarily rely on their sense
of hearing and smell thus may not see or perceive an island when they
enter the water to swim to it. How then do caribou know about the
presence, and subsequently the value, of an island? Social and spatial
cognition are almost certainly involved and tests of the role of
cognition could help elucidate why caribou swim. For example, a novice
individual may trust an experienced individual to lead them to a new
island, a result which is driven by aspects of social cognition
(Seyfarth and Cheney 2015). Meanwhile, once an individual has visited an
island, it may become part of the cognitive map used to navigate within
their home range (e.g. African elephants Loxondonta africana Presotto et
al. 2019).

From our natural history observations and proximal movement data on
caribou swimming, characteristics of destination islands, and residency
on the islands, we have presented some evidence for the marginal value
of resources that may serve as evidence of forage limitation for caribou
swimming between islands. Further investigation into the nuance of
forage profitability, local density, and the role of both social and
spatial cognition is needed. Here, we have proposed a thought exercise
that integrates the marginal value theorem with novel natural history
observations to explain swimming behavior for terrestrial animals and
opens the door for future studies of caribou in our system and other
island archipelagos inhabited by caribou.

<!-- edit caption Fogo Island is the largest
island in the archipelago (237.71 km^2^), but there are at least three other
large islands: Western Indian (77.6 km^2^), Eastern Indian (38.7 km^2^) and
Change (XX km^2^) Islands, as well as numerous smaller islands, including
Blundon’s (1.18 km^2^), North Long (1.01 km^2^), South Long (0.48 km^2^), Kate’s
(1.64 km^2^), and Brother’s (1.59 km^2^) Islands. Habitats are similar across
the archipelago, consisting largely of coniferous and mixed forests of balsam
fir (*Abies balsamea*), black spruce (*Picea mariana*), and white birch 
(*Betula papyrifera*) as well as bogs, lakes, lichen and rocky
barrens.-->
